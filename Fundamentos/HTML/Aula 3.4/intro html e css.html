        <h3>Marine carnivorous crustaceans!</h3>
        <p>
          Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods (<em>Odontodactylus scyllarus</em>), are
          carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda, sub class
          Hoplocarida, class Malacostraca, Subphylum Crustacea, Phylum
          Arthropoda, Kingdom Animalia. Branching from other members of the
          class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimp
          typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can
          reach up to 38 cm (15 in). A mantis shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick
          shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the
          rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax.
          Varieties range in colour from shades of brown to vivid colours, with
          more than 450 species of mantis shrimp known. They are among the most
          important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine
          habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood,
          as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and
          holes.

          Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in
          Australia, and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters"—because
          of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if handled
          incautiously—mantis shrimp have powerful raptorials that are used to
          attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or dismembering.
          Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that can
          strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to
          seize the prey (hence the term "mantis" in its common name).
